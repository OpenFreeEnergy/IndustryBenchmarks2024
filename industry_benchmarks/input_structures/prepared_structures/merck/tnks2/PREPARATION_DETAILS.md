## System preparation details


## Protein
- Schrodinger 2023-4 was used
- Two SO4 molecules were extracted in to a cofactors.sdf file. One Zn was kept in the protein.pdb file
- NME caps were used for A1112 ALA and C1116 GLU termini
## Ligands
- According to the Ref. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2020, 60, 11, 5457–5474, a comprehensive dataset of 27 ligands, including 21 neutral ones, was utilized. 
- A charge visualization step of each ligand, provided in the tnks2_fullmap_ligands.sdf file, was performed using Maestro
- Ligand 8a neutral, 8b netural, 8c neutral, 8d neutral, 8f neutral and 8e adjust were removed from the ligand.sdf file
- 8f, 8a, 8b, 8d, 8c adjust and 8e were identified as the six ligands in their protonated state
- Consequently, the final ligands.sdf file contain 21 neutral ligand and 6 charged ones
