Eg5 Target - Merck dataset


Protein:

- In provided input: only standard amino acids, no cofactors, no ions, some water with HOH standard name, termini caps called ACE / NMA

-> No modifications carried out, except NMA -> NME renaming as suggested

- Input validation script was executed with protein file sucessfully


Ligands:

- In provided input: 28 different ligands of which 6 ligands were given in two different protonation states (-NH vs. - NH2+ groups)

-> Protonation states with lower binding affinity with "CHEMBL*_1" - names were removed , leaving 28 different ligands in one protonation state


Software used:
Modifications carried out manually directly in files (Vi)
