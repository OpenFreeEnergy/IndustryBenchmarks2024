Protein structure from Schrodinger public benchmark set with ligand CHEMBL3402741_400 was reprepared with Protein preparation wizard in Maestro Schrodinger suite version 2024-2 with capped termini (replace hydrogens was switched off to fix protonation states and tautomers for histidines, optimize hbond assignments was turned off and all other settings kept at default). The ligand was used during the preparation to prevent unnatural change in the binding site during the minimization step. It was then deleted and only the protein coordinates were exported.
No cofactors or modified amino acids were present in the system.
Ligands structures were taken from the Schrodinger public benchmark set without modification.
