I) to prep the protein, I used Maesto protein prep with default settings: "cap termini" and "Fill in missing side chains"

1. rename NMA to NME

II) for the ligand sdf input file, I renamed any ligand whose name has a white space: replace the white space with "_"
Renamed these ligands:
“13 flipped” to “13_flipped”
“18 flipped” to “18_flipped”
“16 flipped” to “16_flipped”
“17 flipped” to “17_flipped”
“44 flipped” to “44_flipped”
“43 flipped” to “43_flipped”
“45 flipped” to “45_flipped”
“42 flipped” to “42_flipped”
