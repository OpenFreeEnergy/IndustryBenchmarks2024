I) Protein structure was prepared using Maestro v2024-1 following the recommended steps.
The more dominant(default) alternates were chosen for these residues:
A chain: Cys64, Arg178, His248;
B chain: Arg107, Arg247, HOH438;


II) for the ligand sdf input file, any ligand whose name has a white space was renamed: replacing the white space with "_".
Renamed these ligands:
“13 flipped” to “13_flipped”
“18 flipped” to “18_flipped”
“16 flipped” to “16_flipped”
“17 flipped” to “17_flipped”
“44 flipped” to “44_flipped”
“43 flipped” to “43_flipped”
“45 flipped” to “45_flipped”
“42 flipped” to “42_flipped”
