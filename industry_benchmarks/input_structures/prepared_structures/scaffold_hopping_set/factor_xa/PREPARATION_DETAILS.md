1. Protein structure was prepared following the maestro instructions: https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/IndustryBenchmarks2024/pull/89. Afterward NMA cappings were converted to NME.
2.The structure did not contain any cofactors, the ions were renamed from X1 -> Ca, and no non
natural amino acids were found.
2. Ligands were left unchanged, no protonation or conformational states were detected.
3. tested successfully the input protein with `input_validation.py`
