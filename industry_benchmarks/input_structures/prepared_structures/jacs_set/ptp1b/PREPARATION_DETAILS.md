1. Protein structure was prepared following the maestro instructions: https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/IndustryBenchmarks2024/pull/89. Afterward NMA cappings were converted to NME.
2.The structure did not contain any cofactors and no non natural amino acids were found,
therefore no modifications.
3. Ligands were left unchanged, no protonation or conformational states were detected.
4. tested successfully the input protein with `input_validation.py`
