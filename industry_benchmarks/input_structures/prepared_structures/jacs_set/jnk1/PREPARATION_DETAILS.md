1. Protein structure was prepared following the maestro instructions: https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/IndustryBenchmarks2024/pull/89.
2.The structure did not contain any cofactors and no non natural amino acids were found,
therefore no modifications.
3. Ligands were reduced to the ligands matching this list: https://github.com/schrodinger/public_binding_free_energy_benchmark/blob/main/21_4_results/ligand_predictions/jacs_set/jnk1_manual_flips_symbmcorr_out.csv, the structures were left unchanged, no protonation or conformational states were detected.
4. tested successfully the input protein with `input_validation.py`
