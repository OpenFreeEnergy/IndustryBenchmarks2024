1.  Protein structure was prepared following the maestro instructions: https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/IndustryBenchmarks2024/pull/89.
2.The structure did not contain any cofactors and no non-natural amino acids were found,
therefore no modifications. 
3. Ligands were reduced to the used ligands in: 10.1021/ja512751q. For ligand 27 two stereo isomers were present, we only kept R; structures were left unchanged left unchanged, no conformational states were detected, but protonations changes 
where found and kept, as this is a charge anihilation test set. 
4. tested successfully the input protein with `input_validation.py`

using maestro v2024-2
