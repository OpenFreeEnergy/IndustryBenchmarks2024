Preparation details for misc/btk_extra_flip

Protein preparation done with Maestro 13.5.12

Protein has single chain, starting with GLY 389 terminated -NH3+
This was not modified.  Other end was GLU 658 terminated with
a proton:  -CO-H.  The H was replaced with NME (NME 659) with
the 3D Builder component of Maestro.  The additional capping group
resulted in close contacts so the residues GLU 658 and NME 659
were optimized.  The NMA was changed to NME with vi. 

Ligand preparation (sdf file edited with vi)

Ligand sdf file consisted of 8 ligands but two were alternative
conformer of two others.  The schrodinger dataset listed binding
energy results for ligands 2, 7, 8, 9-flip, 10 and 11. 
Ligands "*-flip" and "9" were removed.
