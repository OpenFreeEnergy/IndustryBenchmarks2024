Preparation  details for fragments/jak2_set2_extra system

Protein preparation:

All modifications made with Maestro 13.5.128 unless noted.

1. ARG 839 (N-terminus) has a ion -NH3+ (left charged, as is)
2. ALA 1131 (C-terminus) has a neutral -CO-H; cap with NME 1132
The NMA capping groups were added, structure optimized and renumbered
with the 3D Builder component of Maestro.
3. The NME capping group was called NMA by Maestro, but 
was renamed to NME using vi.
3. PTR 1007 and 1008 were modified: remove phosphate group  -PO4(2-) 
and replace with -OH.  Rename PTR 1007 and 1008 to TYR.
The PTR modifications were made using 3D Builder component of Maestro.


Ligand preparation:

Original ligand set contained 9 ligands.  Ligand "22" and "22 flip"
are different poses of the same compound.  The Schrodinger ligand
free energy results do not include "22" so that one was removed.
The name of "22 flip" was changed to "22-flip" because a space in the
ligand name caused problems with respect to the file names generated
by OpenFE, which uses the ligand names to construct file names.
