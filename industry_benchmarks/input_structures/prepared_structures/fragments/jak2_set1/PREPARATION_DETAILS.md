Preparation  details for fragments/jak2_set1 system

Protein preparation:

All modifications made with Maestro 13.5.128 unless noted.
1. ASP 840 (N-terminus) has a neutral -NH2; cap with ACE 839
2. ALA 1131 (C-terminus) has a neutral -CO-H; cap with NME 1132
The addtion of the NME capping group resulted in a close
contact with a water molecule.  That water molecule was removed.
The capping groups were added, structure optimized and renumbered
with the 3D Builder component of Maestro.
3. PTR 1007 and 1008 were modified: remove phosphate group  -PO4(2-) 
and replace with -OH.  Rename PTR 1007 and 1008 to TYR.
The PTR modifications were using 3D Builder component of Maestro.
4. The NME capping group was called NMA by Maestro, but 
was renamed to NME using vi.
5. Alternate conformations exist for resid CYS 917, CYS 961, VAL 916, 
ILE 982, ARG 1117.  The conformation with the highest population
was taken.  In each case this was conformer A.

Ligand preparation:

Original ligand set contained 12 ligands.  Ligand "3" and "3 alternative"
are different poses of the same compound.  The Schrodinger ligand
free energy results do not include "3 alternative" so that one was removed.
Ligands 4a and 4b are different protonation states of the same compound.
Both 4a and 4b are included in the Schrodinger free energy results, however, 
4a is a slightly stronger binding. Therefore, 4b was removed.  Removal
of "3 alternative" and 4b results in 10 ligands.
