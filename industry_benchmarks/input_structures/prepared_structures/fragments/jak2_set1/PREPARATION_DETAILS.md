I) to prep the protein, I used Maesto protein prep with default settings: "cap termini" and "Fill in missing side chains"
1. for these 5 residues that have alternates, I chose the more dominant(default) alternate:
Val916
Cys917
Cys961
ILE982
Arg1117

2. mutate p-Tyr 1007 and 1008 to Tyr

3. rename NMA to NME

II) for the ligand sdf input file, I renamed any ligand whose name has a white space: replace the white space with "_"
"3 alternative" is changed to "3_alternative"
