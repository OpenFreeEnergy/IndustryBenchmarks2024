I) Protein structure was prepared using Maestro v2024-1 following the recommended steps.
The more dominant(default) alternates were chosen for these residues:
Val916
Cys917
Cys961
ILE982
Arg1117

And residues p-Tyr 1007 and p-Tyr 1008 were mutated back to Tyr using Maestro.


II) for the ligand sdf input file, any ligand whose name has a white space was renamed: replacing the white space with "_".
"3 alternative" was changed to "3_alternative"
