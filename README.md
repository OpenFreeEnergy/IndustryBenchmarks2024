# OpenFE 2024 Industry Benchmarking Project


Welcome to the OpenFE 2024 Benchmarking Project!


This repository contains input structures, scripts to setup, run and analyze benchmarking calculations, as well as links to the relevant documentation related to the
Open Free Energy 2024 Industry Benchmarking Project.


This project is an industry-led effort to test and validate the [OpenFE software stack](https://docs.openfree.energy/en/stable/).

Validation will be achieved via two separate benchmarking efforts:

* Benchmarking against public datasets
* Benchmarking against private datasets


More details about getting involved, or different portions of this project can be found below or in [our documentation](https://industrybenchmarks2024.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).


## Getting Involved


The industry benchmark project is open to all OpenFE industry partners. If
