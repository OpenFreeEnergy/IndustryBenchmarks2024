Private Dataset Benchmarks

This page outlines the plans and instructions for the private dataset benchmarking portion of the 2024 OpenFE Industry Benchmark study.


.. note::
   Plan for the Private Dataset Benchmarks are still being formulated.
   More details will be provided soon!


Overview
========

The Private Dataset Benchmark focuses on validating the `OpenFE toolkit <https://docs.openfree.energy/en/stable/>`_
using blinded internal datasets from each industry partner. The aim of this study is to evaluate how well the OpenFE toolkit
is likely to perform in production cases.

Here each industry partner will be expected to:

* Gather suitable protein-ligand binding datasets with associated experimental data.
* Use the OpenFE tooling to estimate binding free energies on one or more internal dataset.
* Report blinded correlation plots of free energy estimates against experimental data.

Blinded data will be collated alongside any relevant meta analyses and published in an appropriate location.
